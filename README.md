# ðŸ§  AI-Powered CNP Fraud Detection MVP

This project is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for detecting Card-Not-Present (CNP) fraud using AI, built with Python, XGBoost, and Streamlit.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload transactions or input manually
- Detect fraud probability using a trained XGBoost model
- Track client usage (transactions processed)
- Admin dashboard to monitor usage across clients

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- `Streamlit` â€“ UI frontend for clients and admin  
- `XGBoost` â€“ Trained ML model  
- `scikit-learn` â€“ Evaluation metrics  
- `SHAP` â€“ Model explainability  
- `joblib` â€“ Model persistence  
- `pandas` / `numpy` â€“ Data manipulation
